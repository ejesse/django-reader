Used for aggregating RSS feeds.  A level of abstration is provided between 
RSS (xml) and feedreader, using feedparser (http://www.feedparser.org/).  
An RSS feed must be configured using Django admin interface.

Development enviroment taken from 
http://jacobian.org/writing/django-apps-with-buildout/

Currently, my knowledge of setup tools is poor, and can't add feedparser,
 must install on your own.  This goes against the isolation principal that makes buildout so awesome.
 
Currently this is meant for a home media server, something that is not
public.  If this was to go on a public facing website, do not expose the
update views, as this would poll the RSS feed everytime it is viewed.

ToDo:
Add Functional views, templates.
Make a file that can be executed by a Cron task for updating Feeds
